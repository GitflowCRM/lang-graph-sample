# Project Progress: Chatbot with NestJS, LangChain, and LangGraph

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of a chatbot application built using NestJS for the backend API, and LangChain/LangGraph for the conversational AI logic, including follow-up questions.

## Setup and Initial Implementation

### 1. NestJS Project Scaffolding
- A new NestJS project named `langchain-chatbot` was created using the NestJS CLI.
- Core NestJS dependencies were installed via npm.

### 2. LangChain & LangGraph Integration
- The following npm packages were installed:
    - `langchain`
    - `@langchain/openai`
    - `@langchain/community`
    - `@langchain/core`
    - `@langchain/langgraph`
- A `chat` module was generated, including a `ChatService` and `ChatController`.

### 3. ChatService Implementation (`src/chat/chat.service.ts`)
- **`ChatState` Interface:** Defined to manage the state of the conversation within the LangGraph, including `messages` (BaseMessage[]) and an optional `nextQuestion` (string).
- **OpenAI Model Initialization:** `ChatOpenAI` is initialized with `gpt-4o` and `temperature: 0.8`. The OpenAI API key is retrieved from environment variables using `@nestjs/config`.
- **LangGraph Workflow:** A `StateGraph` is defined with the following nodes:
    - **`chatbot` node:** Invokes the OpenAI model with the current conversation messages.
    - **`decide` node:** Uses a prompt to determine if a follow-up question is needed based on the conversation history. It returns 'YES' or 'NO'.
    - **`followup` node:** Generates a concise follow-up question if the `decide` node returns 'YES'.
- **Graph Transitions:**
    - The workflow starts at the `chatbot` node.
    - After the `chatbot` node, it transitions to the `decide` node.
    - From the `decide` node, it conditionally transitions to the `followup` node if a follow-up is needed, otherwise, it ends the conversation (`END`).
    - After the `followup` node, the conversation ends (`END`).
- **`chat` method:** This public method takes a user message and optional chat history, invokes the LangGraph workflow, and returns the chatbot's response along with any generated follow-up question.

### 4. ChatController Implementation (`src/chat/chat.controller.ts`)
- A `ChatController` was created to expose the chatbot functionality via a REST API endpoint.
- The `@Post()` decorator is used for the `/chat` endpoint.
- The `sendMessage` method accepts a `message` and `history` (for persistent conversation) from the request body and calls the `ChatService.chat` method.
- The response now includes both the chatbot's reply and an optional `followUp` question.

### 5. Environment Configuration
- A `.env` file was created at the project root (`langchain-chatbot/.env`).
- `@nestjs/config` was installed and configured in `src/app.module.ts` to load environment variables globally.
- `ConfigModule` was imported into `src/chat/chat.module.ts` to allow `ChatService` to access environment variables.

## Next Steps

1.  **Set OpenAI API Key:** Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` in the `.env` file with your actual OpenAI API key.
2.  **Run the Application:** Start the NestJS application in development mode.
3.  **Test the API:** Use a tool like `curl`, Postman, or Insomnia to send POST requests to `http://localhost:3000/chat` and test the chatbot's responses and follow-up questions.
4.  **Enhance LangGraph:** Explore adding more complex nodes for tool usage, external API calls, or more sophisticated memory management.
5.  **Implement Persistent History:** Develop a strategy to store and retrieve chat history (e.g., using a database or session management) to maintain conversation context across multiple requests.
